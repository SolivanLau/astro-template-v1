## ðŸ”Œ Plugins & Packages

Outside of Astro's usual plugin and package configuration, the following plugins and packages are used for the frontend:

### Astro Plugins

-   [Netlify SSR Adapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/netlify/#_top/) for **hybrid** SSG and Server Side Deployment.
-   [Astro Icons](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon) for straight forward SVG icons.
-   [Astro Prettier Plugin](https://github.com/withastro/prettier-plugin-astro) for project specific code formatting.

### Project Packages

-   [qs](https://github.com/ljharb/qs) for handling query parameters in Strapi CMS REST API.
-   [sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) for strict package manager environments using the default image service for `astro:assets`. NPM environments for instance, can remove this dependency.
-   [sass](https://github.com/sass/scss) for compiling SCSS to CSS.
-   [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for project specific code formatting.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

This Astro project follows a similar structure to a standard , adding a few more folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
|   â”œâ”€â”€ fonts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ icons/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
